# cpdn_regions

The purpose of this code is to plot CPDN region boundaries on a map and animation

To add a new region:

1. Add a new region to the regions dictionary specifying the region colour and whether it is to be displayed as a dotted line
2. Add an example regional output netcdf file to the data directory using the filename convention:
<region_abbreviation>_region.nc
